[Gforth](http://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/) is the GNU implementation of [Forth][wiki], a stack-based low-level programming language.  Documentation for Gforth is available at http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/.

This image contains the latest version of Gforth compiled from source and includes support for [the C foreign function interface](http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/C-Interface.html) and disassembly with GDB.

Gforth source files defining extra features are located in `/usr/share/gforth/$GFORTH_VERSION`.  This directory is in Gforth's default search path, and so you just need to run, say, `include random.fs` to be able to use `seed`, `rnd`, and `random`.

## Execution

Starting the image without any arguments puts you in interactive (REPL) mode, which is often what you want:

    $ docker run -it jwodder/gforth

Alternatively, you can run a Forth script from your current directory as follows:

    $ docker run -it -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp jwodder/gforth gforth your-script.fs -e bye

Note that the `-e bye` at the end is needed to keep Gforth from entering interactive mode once the script completes.
